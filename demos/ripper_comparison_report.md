# RIPPER-family comparison: Weka:JRip / Witt:RIPPER / Pypper / Slipper

## Setup

**Full run** (44 binary datasets). For a quick sanity check instead (10 small datasets, 3-fold, well under a minute): `python demos/ripper_comparison.py` with no arguments -- its output isn't checked in (see `ripper_comparison_quick_report.md` after running it).

Four RIPPER-family rule learners -- Weka:JRip, Witt:RIPPER,
Pypper, Slipper -- compared on 44 binary datasets from
`pyrulearn.experiments.catalog`.

A fifth, IMod:Slipper (`imodels`' SlipperClassifier), is checked
separately first against the native Slipper on a handful of small,
low-feature-count datasets, then left out of the main comparison below --
see "Why IMod:Slipper isn't in the main comparison". Across 4 datasets (3-fold), IMod:Slipper was no more accurate than Slipper (mean accuracy 68.95% vs. 81.40%) while taking 130x as long per fit (6.38s vs. 0.05s, mean) -- not worth its cost at the scale of the main comparison below.

Protocol: `10`-fold stratified cross-validation
(`pyrulearn.experiments.runner.run_cv`), one `DataSpec` per training fold
(`build_dataspec(max_intervals=6)`), the test fold binarized
against that same `DataSpec` -- every learner sees the identical
binary features per fold (as vertical bitmaps, the library's default representation;
the Weka learners convert them to the matrix they need), so differences
reflect the algorithms, not the data preparation. Each fit is capped at 180s; a
timeout or an exception is recorded as a failure, not fatal to the run.

A fold that times out fails the whole cross-validation of that learner on that dataset (`run_cv`'s `stop_on_timeout`): its remaining folds are not run, and all its folds count as failures, so no mean rests on just the folds that finished.

Measures: test accuracy, rule count, total condition count, fit time
(seconds, JVM startup included for Weka:JRip). Witt:RIPPER auto-dispatches
one-vs-rest for multi-class (see the module docstring); every other
learner handles multi-class natively.

Every learner runs single-threaded; fits run 10 at a time (`run_cv`'s `n_jobs`), each in its own process and timed there, with the numerical libraries limited to one thread (`OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` and its relatives). A check of the `dense_vs_modular` learners on 11 datasets found the fit times of 5 concurrent fits as close to a sequential run as a second sequential run (per-learner ratios and rankings alike); time ratios between learners are reproducible to about +-10% either way.

The same for fit time, rank 1 the fastest:

## Why IMod:Slipper isn't in the main comparison

Across 4 datasets (3-fold), IMod:Slipper was no more accurate than Slipper (mean accuracy 68.95% vs. 81.40%) while taking 130x as long per fit (6.38s vs. 0.05s, mean) -- not worth its cost at the scale of the main comparison below.

## Summary by learner (mean across every dataset and fold)

| learner | accuracy | n_rules | conds/rule | fit_time (s) | wins | mean rank |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| Weka:JRip | 84.99% | 5.1 | 3.0 | 0.97 | 13.2 | 2.12 |

| Witt:RIPPER | 79.76% | 6.4 | 3.1 | 1.63 | 4.2 | 3.30 |

`wins` -- datasets where a learner's mean accuracy was (tied-for-)best, a tie split evenly (`pyrulearn.experiments.stats.win_counts`); `mean rank` -- average accuracy rank across datasets, failures tied for last (`stats.mean_rank`).
