demos/covering_boosting.py
===========================

Two angles on the same question -- what should happen to an example once
an accepted rule covers it? -- in one framework, because they turn out
to literally share code:

- **Removal covering** (the classic separate-and-conquer default):
  covered examples leave the scope entirely.
- **Weighted covering**: covered examples stay, reweighted by a
  `pyrulearn.learners.seco.Reweighting` scheme -- multiplicative/additive
  (CN2-SD), or `LRIReweighting` (Lightweight Rule Induction) -- until a
  `CoveringStop` criterion is met.
- **Boosting**: `Slipper` (Cohen & Singer 1999) is `WeightedCovering`
  with `AdaBoostReweighting` -- the *same* `CoveringState`/reweighting
  machinery as the line above, just assigning each rule a fitted weight
  (confidence), which plain `SeCo` refuses to build into an unweighted
  rule set (see `SeCo`'s own `covering=` docstring) -- so it needs its
  own learner class, `Slipper`, but not its own mechanism. `ENDER`
  (gradient boosting of rules for a pluggable loss) and its `Boomer`
  configuration aren't as separate from this as they look, either:
  AdaBoost reweighting *is* gradient boosting on the exponential loss
  (Friedman, Hastie & Tibshirani 2000) -- `ENDER`'s `ExponentialLoss`
  defines its per-example quantity as the same `exp(-y f)` AdaBoost
  reweights by, and fits each rule's weight with the identical closed
  form `AdaBoostReweighting.confidence` uses. What they don't share:
  `ENDER`'s *other* losses (logistic, sigmoid) and weight-fitting
  methods have no reweighting-scheme equivalent at all, and weighted
  covering discards its weights at predict time (a heuristic scores an
  unweighted rule set) while boosting bakes the fitted weight into the
  model itself (`LinearRuleModel`, summed at predict time).

Two sections, one report:

- **Section 1 -- covering strategies**: a fixed search (beam width 5)
  and rule-growing setup, crossed with covering strategy (removal;
  weighted, multiplicative/additive/LRI) and heuristic (Laplace, WRAcc,
  m-estimate with m=16 -- `demos/heuristic_comparison.py`'s own measured
  best-performing setting),
  via plain `SeCo`. `CPAR` and `LRI` sit alongside as complete
  algorithms (their own classes -- extra procedure beyond a bare
  reweighting scheme, not expressible as a `SeCo` config). Deliberately
  *not* reusing `CN2`'s own significance-based stopping here: that's a
  search-level criterion that can end the covering loop by itself, which
  would confound the comparison this section is actually about.
- **Section 2 -- boosting**: `Slipper`, `ENDER` (a few representative
  configs: the paper's default CS-Log, CS-Exp, and MLRules'
  newton/subsample setting), `Boomer`. Headline measure is accuracy vs.
  rule count as a curve (refit at a few `n_rounds`/`n_rules` budgets),
  not one fitted size -- simpler than hunting for a staged-prediction
  shortcut, if more fits.

A closing **comparative discussion**, built fresh from the measured
numbers each run, ties the two sections together: Slipper's point here
is directly comparable to section 1's `WeightedCovering` +
`AdaBoostReweighting` entry (same mechanism), and to `ENDER`'s
exponential-loss configuration (the same mechanism again, by a
classical result -- see the module docstring above); `ENDER`'s other
losses, and weighted covering's non-exponential schemes, are where the
two families actually part ways.

Datasets: the same two-class, mostly-symbolic list as
`demos/seco_learners_comparison.py`'s `FULL_BINARY` -- these learners'
weighted-covering/boosting machinery is inherently a one-class-vs-rest
framing, and that list is already curated for exactly this learner
family.

Measures: accuracy, rule count, rule length (conditions per rule), fit
time, and "overlap" -- the mean number of a model's rules covering a
test row, pooled across every concept the model has (not restricted to
one "positive" class: a plain `SeCo` config here builds a one-vs-rest
`ConceptSet` with no single target class to restrict to). Each fit
(section 1 or 2) is capped at {FIT_TIMEOUT}s; a time-out or an error
counts as a failure, not as the end of the run.

Run: `python demos/covering_boosting.py` with no arguments is
the **quick** default; its report isn't checked in. `--full` runs both
sections at full scale and writes the canonical report.

`Boomer`) on the same datasets/folds, at rule-count budgets
{N_RULES_BUDGETS}.

Protocol: stratified cross-validation (`pyrulearn.experiments.runner.run_cv`), one
`DataSpec` per training fold (`build_dataspec(max_intervals={MAX_INTERVALS})`), the test
fold encoded against that same `DataSpec`, in the library's default representation
(N-lists). Each fit is capped at {FIT_TIMEOUT:.0f}s; a time-out or an error counts
as a failure, not as the end of the run, and is excluded from every
mean it would otherwise enter (a "failures" column reports the count
instead).{_concurrency_note()}

Measures: accuracy, rule count, conditions per rule, fit time, and
overlap (mean rules covering a test row, pooled across every concept --
see the module docstring for why this isn't restricted to one
"positive" class).
