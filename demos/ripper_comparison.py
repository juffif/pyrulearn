demos/ripper_comparison.py
==========================

Four RIPPER-family rule learners (Slipper included -- Cohen & Singer's
own confidence-rated-boosting follow-up to RIPPER, not a separate
family), cross-validated through `pyrulearn.experiments.runner.run_cv`
(shared per-fold binarization, per-fit timeout, uniform measurement,
fold caching) on datasets from `pyrulearn.experiments.catalog` -- this
demo picks the learners, the datasets, and what to report; everything
else is the shared infrastructure. Two run sizes (see "Run:" below):
**quick** (10 small datasets, the no-args default, output not
checked in) and **full** (`FULL_DATASETS_SPEC` -- every small/medium
binary dataset, 44 of them -- or any other `--datasets` spec, output to
the checked-in report/plots):

- **Weka:JRip**   -- Weka's `weka.classifiers.rules.JRip`, via
                     `pyrulearn.interfaces.weka.WekaJRip` (subprocess,
                     needs a local Weka install -- see `WEKA_JAR`/
                     `WEKA_JAVA` below).
- **Witt:RIPPER** -- the `wittgenstein` package's RIPPER, via
                     `pyrulearn.interfaces.wittgenstein.WittRIPPER`.
                     Natively binary; the local subclass below overrides
                     `_default_model` so `fit(data)` (as `run_cv` always
                     calls it, no `model=`) auto-dispatches to
                     `ConceptModel` for a binary target or `ConceptSet`
                     (one-vs-rest) for multi-class, so one learner
                     instance handles every dataset here.
- **Pypper**      -- pyrulearn's own RIPPER re-implementation
                     (`pyrulearn.learners.seco.Pypper`): IREP* growth/
                     pruning plus `ReplaceReviseOptimization`, per class
                     inside a least-frequent-first ordered decomposition.
- **Slipper**     -- pyrulearn's own SLIPPER (Cohen & Singer, 1999):
                     confidence-rated boosting of rules
                     (`pyrulearn.learners.boosting.Slipper`).

`IMod:Slipper` (`imodels`' `SlipperClassifier`, `pyrulearn.interfaces.
imodels.IModSlipper` -- despite the name, a different algorithm from the
native `Slipper` above, see its own docstring) is deliberately **not**
in that main comparison: `run_preliminary_slipper_check` fits it against
the native `Slipper` on `PRELIM_DATASETS` (a handful of small, few-
feature datasets, so this check itself stays quick) first, and its
result -- consistently much slower, for no accuracy gain (on a couple of
sampled larger datasets it was 20-60x slower than every other learner
here, once timing out outright at a 60s budget on a plain 1,000-row
dataset) -- is the report's own argument for excluding it, not an
unexplained absence. It's binary-only regardless (see `IModSlipper`'s
docstring), so it would have needed dropping from any multi-class run
anyway.

All four main-comparison learners see the identical per-fold binarized
data (`build_dataspec`/`binarize`, `MAX_INTERVALS` discretization), in the
library's default representation, vertical bitmaps (the Weka learners convert it to
the dense matrix they need) -- no learner here gets the raw, non-binarized
data.
That comparison (a learner's own intrinsic numeric handling vs. our
discretization) is a deliberately separate, later demo
(`examples/REVISION_PLAN.md`'s comparison (e)); this one used to also
run Weka JRip on raw data (`jrip_native`) as a preview of that, which is
why the two are related but no longer why they're the same script.

Run: `python demos/ripper_comparison.py` with no arguments is the
**quick** default -- `QUICK_DATASETS_SPEC` (10 small datasets),
`QUICK_FOLDS`-fold, well under a minute; its report/plots go to
``ripper_comparison_quick_*`` and are *not* checked in (see
`.gitignore`) -- rerun it any time for a fast sanity check. `--full` (or
an explicit `--datasets <spec>`) runs the full comparison instead
(`FULL_DATASETS_SPEC`, `N_FOLDS`-fold) and writes to the canonical
``ripper_comparison_report.md``/``.png`` paths, which *are* checked
in -- a sample from a real full run, not regenerated on every change to
this script. Either way needs Weka installed at `WEKA_JAR`/`WEKA_JAVA`
below, plus the `experiments`, `wittgenstein` and `imodels` extras.

{mode_note}Four RIPPER-family rule learners -- Weka:JRip, Witt:RIPPER,
Pypper, Slipper -- compared on {dataset_count} datasets from
`pyrulearn.experiments.catalog`.

A fifth, IMod:Slipper (`imodels`' SlipperClassifier), is checked
separately first against the native Slipper on a handful of small,
low-feature-count datasets, then left out of the main comparison below --
see "Why IMod:Slipper isn't in the main comparison". {prelim_verdict}

Protocol: `{n_folds}`-fold stratified cross-validation
(`pyrulearn.experiments.runner.run_cv`), one `DataSpec` per training fold
(`build_dataspec(discretizer=TreeDiscretizer(max_intervals={MAX_INTERVALS}))`), the test fold binarized
against that same `DataSpec` -- every learner sees the identical
binary features per fold (as vertical bitmaps, the library's default representation;
the Weka learners convert them to the matrix they need), so differences
reflect the algorithms, not the data preparation. Each fit is capped at {FIT_TIMEOUT:.0f}s; a
timeout or an exception is recorded as a failure, not fatal to the run.

A fold that times out fails the whole cross-validation of that learner on that dataset (`run_cv`'s `stop_on_timeout`): its remaining folds are not run, and all its folds count as failures, so no mean rests on just the folds that finished.

Measures: test accuracy, rule count, total condition count, fit time
(seconds, JVM startup included for Weka:JRip). Witt:RIPPER auto-dispatches
one-vs-rest for multi-class (see the module docstring); every other
learner handles multi-class natively.{_concurrency_note()}
