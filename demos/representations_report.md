# Data representations: same rules, different speed

**Full run.** Quick sanity check instead: `python demos/representations.py`.

pyrulearn's learners never look at the data directly. They ask it two things -- which examples a rule covers (`coverage(rule)`) and which features an example has (`features_of(row)`) -- so the data can be stored in any structure that answers these questions. Four such representations are implemented:

- **HBitmap** (horizontal bitmap) -- a bit matrix packed by example, one bit per example and feature. Covering a rule checks every example's row against the rule's features, whatever the density.
- **VBitmap** (vertical bitmap) -- the same bit matrix packed by feature: one bit-vector over the examples per feature. Covering a rule ANDs its features' bit-vectors, and counting is a popcount; same memory as HBitmap.
- **NList** -- LORD's vertical index (Huynh, Fürnkranz & Beck, 2023): examples are inserted into a prefix tree of their true features, and each feature keeps the list of tree nodes it occurs in (its N-list). Covering a rule intersects these lists; the work grows with how often the features are true, not with the number of examples.
- **Sparse** -- `scipy` sparse matrices: per-feature example lists without the prefix tree.

All four must lead to exactly the same rules, so the only thing that differs is time. This demo measures that time for five learners -- CN2, PFossil, Pypper, PyLORD and ENDER, each with its default settings -- and checks the rules and the test-set predictions against HBitmap at every point. Each fit runs in a separate process and is capped at 300s, PyLORD's at 600s; after a time-out, the larger points of that curve are skipped. The learners ran side by side, one worker process each, every learner's fits one after another; building the representations, timing `coverage()` and measuring memory came first, with nothing else running. Only PyLORD's points that timed out under the earlier 300s cap were fitted again under 600s, side by side in separate processes on an otherwise idle machine; all other fits come from the run before. The numerical libraries were limited to one thread (`OMP_NUM_THREADS=1` and its relatives), so each fit used one core.

**Equality check:** at 148 points where HBitmap and at least one other representation finished, 148 gave identical rules and predictions for every representation.

## 1. Training-set size

Training sets of doubling size, drawn from one shuffled pool of the `adult` dataset (48,842 examples, 14 attributes, 8 of them nominal), each evaluated on the same 20% test set. Numeric attributes are discretized per training set (`TreeDiscretizer(max_intervals=8)`). Two encodings: **with negation** (pyrulearn's default -- every test comes with its negation, so exactly half the features are true in every example) and **without negation** (no `x != v` features; numeric attributes keep both `x >= t` and `x < t`, so it is sparser only in the nominal attributes). The first is the bitmaps' best case and the list-based representations' worst; the second is where those should gain.

At the largest training set: with negation 278 binary features, density 0.493; without negation 182 binary features, density 0.274 (density = share of features that are true).

One pair of plots per learner: left with a logarithmic time axis (ratios -- a constant factor between two representations is a constant gap), right with a linear one (absolute seconds saved).

**Growth.** How fast each learner's fit time grows with the training-set size: the exponent *b* of time ~ n^*b*, fitted by least squares to log time over log n from n=2,000 on (below that, a fit's fixed costs still dominate). 1 is linear, 2 quadratic; a curve cut short by a time-out is fitted on the points that finished. This is what decides, for example, how much a learner gains from splitting a problem into smaller ones (`demos/multiclass_decomposition.py`):

Building a vertical index is paid once per fit, on top of the fit itself:

![index build time vs. training-set size](representations_plots/size_index_build.png)

**Memory.** What each representation holds once built, measured with `tracemalloc` (the input matrix and the HBitmap matrix the others are built from don't count), and in parentheses its share of HBitmap's memory; the last row is the unpacked `n x k` bool matrix that `data.X` builds on demand, which any learner or external library working on a plain array pays on top.

## 2. Density

Synthetic data, 1000 training and 1000 test examples with 500 features: 4 of them carry a fixed learnable concept (true with probability 0.4, class = f0 and not f1, 5% label noise); every other feature is noise, true with the probability on the x-axis. Size and feature count stay fixed, so this isolates density.

## 3. Width

Synthetic data again, 1000 training and 1000 test examples, the same concept on 4 signal features -- but now the number of *true* features per example stays fixed (on average 16 noise features, plus the signal ones) while the number of features grows. That is how sparse data usually looks: one-hot encodings of attributes with many values, or words in a text. The bitmaps grow with the number of features (one bit per cell); a sparse representation with the number of true cells, which stays the same. `Sparse` keeps two copies of a 4-byte index plus a 1-byte value per true cell, about 10 bytes against 1/8 byte per cell for the bitmaps, so it should take less memory below a density of about 1/80 -- here from about 1,408 features on.

Memory a fit costs in total -- what the representation holds plus the peak the fit allocates on top of it, caches the representation builds during the fit included (`tracemalloc`, a separate untimed pass):
