pyrulearn.pruning
====================

`PrePruningCriterion`: a single per-candidate test, consumed three
different ways depending on who's asking --

- as a **filter** (a region no *returned* rule may occupy; checked
  continuously and independent of exploration -- a candidate sitting in
  the excluded region keeps getting refined exactly as it would
  otherwise), via `pyrulearn.learners.seco.BeamSearch`/`HillClimbing`'s
  `filtering=`,
- as a **stopping** trigger -- everything `filtering` does (a returned
  rule is never in the excluded region) *plus* halting the search the
  moment the frontier crosses into it (checked from the first
  refinement onward -- never against the seed candidate). Because it
  quits rather than keep looking, `stopping` can miss a rule that would
  have re-entered the acceptable region a few refinements deeper, which
  `filtering` alone would still find. Via those same classes'
  `stopping=`, or
- as the outer covering loop's own stop condition, via
  `pyrulearn.learners.seco.SeCo`'s `stop_covering=` -- consulted through bare
  `evaluate()` alone, with `polarity`/`accept`/`reject` playing no role
  (there's only ever one covering loop, never a population to filter
  among, so a fired criterion always just means "stop, and discard what
  was just found" -- see `SeCo`'s own docstring).

Same criterion, same `evaluate`/`accept`/`reject` methods regardless of
which of the three a given instance ends up passed to; see each
consuming class's own docstring for exactly how it applies them.

"Pre-pruning" (as opposed to `pyrulearn.learners.seco.ReducedErrorPruning`'s
*post*-pruning, which truncates an already-fully-grown rule afterward)
-- filtering and stopping both act mid-search, before a rule is ever
finished, unlike post-pruning's "grow it fully, then cut it back"; the
covering-loop use acts between complete rules, but still before the
*ruleset* as a whole is finished.

This module only defines the criteria themselves; every consumer
(`RuleSearch`/`BeamSearch`/`HillClimbing`/`GainAscentHillClimbing`/
`SeCo`) lives in `pyrulearn.learners.seco`.

class PrePruningCriterion(ABC):
    """A single per-candidate test -- see the module docstring for how
    the same instance is consumed as a filter, a stopping trigger, or
    (via bare `evaluate()` alone, ignoring `polarity`/`accept`/`reject`
    entirely) `pyrulearn.learners.seco.SeCo`'s own `stop_covering`.

    `evaluate` is the one method a subclass implements: a raw,
    per-round predicate, phrased however is natural for the check at
    hand (e.g. "is this rule currently significant"). On its own it
    carries no notion of "good" or "bad" -- `polarity` (default `True`)
    says whether `evaluate() == True` means REJECT (the default) or
    ACCEPT. `reject`/`accept` are generic and never overridden:

        reject(...) == (evaluate(...) == polarity)
        accept(...) == not reject(...)

    Choosing `polarity` is a real decision, not boilerplate -- it's
    what lets the same shape of criterion express two different search
    behaviors when used for *stopping*. Phrase `evaluate` as "the
    condition that should make the search consider stopping" (it needs
    to become true at the exact moment that matters, whichever
    direction that is), then pick `polarity` to make `reject`/`accept`
    mean what you actually want for filtering:

    - CN2's significance test: `evaluate` = "is this rule no longer
      significant" (`LikelihoodRatio() < threshold`) -- becomes true
      exactly when significance is lost, the moment you want the
      search to stop and consider its answer. `polarity=True` (the
      default) gives `reject() == evaluate()`: reject exactly the
      insignificant rules -- the natural filtering meaning too.
    - "Stop once precision reaches 0.8": `evaluate` = "is precision now
      >= 0.8" -- becomes true exactly when you've reached "good
      enough". Here `accept()`, not `reject()`, should equal
      `evaluate()` directly, so `polarity=False`.

    A search consuming this as a stopping trigger checks `evaluate`
    each round; the moment it fires, `accept` on that same candidate
    decides what to return -- itself if `accept()` is `True` (in the
    CN2 example this branch is never taken: `reject()==evaluate()`
    means `accept()` is always `False` exactly when `evaluate()` just
    fired), otherwise the best rule the search had from *strictly
    before* the triggering round that was in every criterion's
    acceptable region (`pyrulearn.learners.seco.BeamSearch`: its running best;
    `pyrulearn.learners.seco.HillClimbing`: the most recent such rule -- they
    differ because one tracks a running best and the other doesn't; see
    each class's own docstring). That is `None` if there was no such
    rule -- so a criterion used as `stopping` never hands back a rule
    from its own reject region (e.g. FOSSIL's `Correlation < 0.3`
    firing on the first refinement returns `None`, not that
    sub-threshold rule).

    `stats` is passed in already computed (by whatever's driving the
    search) rather than recomputed here -- avoids a second `RuleStats.
    from_rule` pass over the same candidate purely for this check.

    Unconditional floor, independent of any criterion configured here:
    a `RuleSearch` stops specializing a candidate once its `stats.tp ==
    0` (provably pointless -- specialization only ever shrinks coverage,
    so every descendant would also have `tp == 0`), and, unless
    `optimistic_pruning=False`, once the heuristic's score at the
    candidate's optimistic `(tp, 0)` point (the best any refinement
    could ever reach) no longer beats the best rule found so far --
    `pyrulearn.learners.seco.BeamSearch`/`HillClimbing`/`GainAscentHillClimbing`
    own the details (and the flag), including how the whole search, not
    just one lineage, halts once *nothing* in flight still promises to
    improve. That optimistic bound subsumes the older `fp == 0` floor it
    replaced: a pure rule's `(tp, 0)` bound is just its own score, which
    the running best already reflects. These checks are direct scalar
    comparisons / single `heuristic.score` calls in the search loop
    itself, not routed through this class -- cheap and frequent enough
    that virtual dispatch would be a real fraction of their cost; a
    `PrePruningCriterion` is for genuinely configurable, typically
    heavier checks (e.g. CN2's significance test) layered on top of that
    floor.

    Learning* 5(3):239-266, p. 251, verified directly against the
    primary source): stop extending a clause the moment it becomes more
    expensive to write down than to simply list which examples it
    covers.

    Quinlan phrases this for first-order Horn clauses, where each
    literal is a relation applied to a tuple of (bound or free)
    variables; the bits needed to code one literal are 1 (negated or
    not) + log2(number of relations) (which relation) + log2(number of
    possible arguments) (which variables). This propositional collapse
    drops the last term entirely (a propositional literal binds no
    variables) and folds "which relation" into "which feature", giving
    `1 + log2(d)` bits per literal, with `d` = the number of features
    available in `data.spec` -- exactly the simplification
    the formula reduces to outside a relational setting.

    `evaluate()`: with `l = rule.length()` (literals so far) and `N`/`p`
    = `stats`'s total examples / covered positives (within whatever
    scope `stats` was computed against -- the search's own
    `example_mask`, same as everywhere else in this module),

        encoding_length = l * (1 + log2(d)) - log2(l!)

        evaluate() = encoding_length > benefit

    fires the moment growing the clause further costs more bits than it
    saves -- exactly the round Quinlan's own criterion is meant to
    intervene at. The `-log2(l!)` term (Quinlan's own correction, kept
    as-is) accounts for every ordering of the same `l` literals meaning
    the same clause. `polarity=True` (the default, unchanged) gives the
    CN2-shaped reading: `reject()==evaluate()`, rejecting exactly the
    over-expensive rules -- the same "leave" direction CN2's
    significance test uses (see `PrePruningCriterion`'s own docstring),
    and the natural choice as a `stopping=` criterion for
    `pyrulearn.learners.seco.PFoil`.

    Never fires against the empty (length-0) rule -- `evaluate()`
    returns `False` unconditionally there, matching every other
    criterion in this module's convention that a seed candidate is
    never itself "too expensive" (an empty clause costs 0 bits to
    encode by construction).
