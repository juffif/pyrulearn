"""
pyrulearn.learners.seco
===========================

A generic separate-and-conquer (SeCo) rule learner, built from five
composable building blocks (see Fürnkranz's SeCo survey for the general
shape this follows):

1. **search for a single rule** -- `RuleSearch`. `BeamSearch` (any
   `RuleHeuristic` except `GainHeuristic`, `beam_width` at least 1) is
   the general-purpose default; `HillClimbing` is its single-lineage
   greedy special case (`beam_width` 1 plus "stop at a local maximum of
   the heuristic"); `GainAscentHillClimbing` is a further subclass, the
   only search that can run a `GainHeuristic` (e.g. `FoilGain`) -- a
   gain score is only meaningful against its own immediate parent, and a
   single lineage is the one place "only one parent, ever" holds (see
   `BeamSearch`'s docstring for why it can't rank gain scores safely at
   any beam width).
2. **a search heuristic** -- already existed before this module:
   `pyrulearn.heuristics.RuleHeuristic`/`RuleStats`/`GainHeuristic`/
   `DeltaGain`, reused as-is. `BeamSearch`/`HillClimbing`/
   `GainAscentHillClimbing`'s own
   `filtering=`/`stopping=` criteria (`pyrulearn.pruning.
   PrePruningCriterion` and friends) live in their own module too,
   since they're equally reusable outside a SeCo-shaped loop.
3. **prepare for learning a single rule** -- `SingleRulePreparation`
   (`NoSplit` default; `GrowPruneSplit` for RIPPER/IREP-style behavior).
4. **post-process a single rule** -- `SingleRulePostProcessing`
   (`NoPostProcessing` default; `ReducedErrorPruning` for RIPPER/IREP-
   style behavior).
5. **initialize the search space** -- `SearchSpaceInit`
   (`EmptyRuleAllFeatures` default; `FeatureSubset` for a named subset;
   `SeedExample` for AQ's single-example seed -- generalize one still-
   uncovered positive rather than start from the fully-open empty rule).

These five compose into `SingleRuleLearner`. The outer `SeCo`
sequential-covering loop (subclasses `pyrulearn.learners.
NativeRuleLearner`) calls it repeatedly: learn one rule, remove every
example it covers (both classes -- see `SeCo`'s own docstring) from
further consideration, repeat until `stop_covering` (a
`pyrulearn.pruning.PrePruningCriterion`, same as `filtering=`/
`stopping=`, but consulted only via its bare `evaluate()` -- see
`SeCo`'s own docstring) says stop, the single-rule search returns
nothing (`filtering` rejected everything it reached), or no positive
examples remain uncovered. `RuleSet`-level
preparation/post-processing (e.g. RIPPER's whole-set optimization
phase, revisiting rules already added in light of each other) is a
separate, higher-level pair of hooks around that outer loop, distinct
from building blocks 3/4 above (which only ever see one rule in
isolation) -- not yet implemented; `SeCo` as built so far always
accepts every rule it finds (down to the covering criterion) without
ever reconsidering earlier ones.

Throughout, `target_class` is a fixed parameter -- every building block
only ever finds/scores rules for one predetermined class. Multi-class is
handled *around* this machinery, via the `fit(data, model=...)` switcher
(see `pyrulearn.learners.RuleLearner.fit`) -- `fit(data)` with no
`target_class` builds `_MULTICLASS_DEFAULT` (`ConceptSet`, one-vs-rest,
for the SeCo family):
- a binary decomposition (`model=ConceptSet | ConceptCascade |
  PairwiseModel` -- one-vs-rest / ordered peeling / round robin, via
  `DecomposingLearner`; `pyrulearn.learners.multiclass` wraps these as thin sugar)
  fitting copies of itself with `target_class` set; or
- `model=DecisionList` (`AQR`'s own `_MULTICLASS_DEFAULT`):
  `SeCo._seed_covering_fit`, one covering loop over all classes at once,
  each rule seeded on a random uncovered example and headed with that
  example's own label -- AQ's multi-class covering, rules kept in learn
  order (`model=FlatRuleSet` gives the same rules resolved by that order,
  `ListCombiner()`).

A single global "best rule for any class" search (the early-CN2 entropy
heuristic) is a different, deferred thing; when built it would also wrap
this machinery from the outside (calling `SingleRuleLearner.
learn_one_rule` once per candidate class and picking the best via a
heuristic comparable across classes), not rework anything here.

"Masks, not splits": every one of these building blocks that needs to
restrict which examples are in scope (a grow/prune split, "which
examples are still uncovered") does so via a boolean `example_mask` over
`data`'s rows, not by constructing a smaller
`BooleanDataRepresentation`. This is already how `RuleStats.from_rule`
and `Rule.specialize` work; the pieces built here just thread that mask
through rather than reintroducing a splitting approach.

The `example_mask` may also be a non-negative *weight vector* -- a
weighted covering scope (`WeightedCovering`) -- and the data may carry
row weights of its own (`pyrulearn.data.DataRepresentation.weights`).
Everything that counts examples then sums their effective weights
(`DataRepresentation.scope`); everything that only needs to know which
rows are in scope (seed picking, the grow/prune split) takes the rows
with a positive weight. How the scope evolves from one rule to the next
is `SeCo`'s `covering` strategy: `RemovalCovering` (the default, the
classic "separate") or `WeightedCovering`.

class BeamSearch(RuleSearch):
    """Standard top-down beam search: starting from `initial_candidates`,
    repeatedly specialize every rule currently in the beam by one
    literal (`Rule.specialize`), keep the `beam_width` highest-scoring
    results, and stop once no further specialization is possible, no
    beam member still looks capable of beating the best rule found so
    far (`optimistic_pruning`, on by default -- see below), or
    `max_conditions` refinement steps have happened (if given). Returns
    the single best-scoring rule seen at any point, not just whatever
    ends up in the final beam -- an earlier, shorter rule can outscore
    every one of its own descendants (ties broken toward the shorter
    rule, so a later-round rediscovery of an already-optimal candidate
    via extra, non-restricting conditions never displaces the shorter
    original in the beam). With `filtering` configured, only a
    filter-passing rule is ever eligible to be that best -- if none was
    reached, the search returns `None` (see `filtering`, below).

    `optimistic_pruning` (default `True`) bounds the search the way
    Fürnkranz's SeCo survey describes: a rule covering `tp` positives
    and `fp` negatives can, at very best, refine into one covering those
    same `tp` positives and *no* negatives, so if the heuristic's score
    at that hypothetical `(tp, 0)` point doesn't exceed the best score
    found so far, no refinement of this candidate ever will and it isn't
    specialized. This is checked against each beam member just before it
    would be expanded for the next round; once it holds for *every* rule
    in the beam at once, the whole search stops.

    "Best score found so far" means the best score of a rule that has
    actually passed `filtering` (`best_rule`'s score) -- that's the best
    result the search could return, so it's the only sound bound. With
    no `filtering` configured, that's just the plain running best. While
    nothing has passed `filtering` yet there's no bound at all and
    nothing is pruned -- so a strict `filtering` criterion makes
    optimistic pruning kick in later (a lower filtered-best is a weaker
    bound), never earlier, and can never cause the search to skip a
    branch it would otherwise have kept.

    This replaces an older unconditional "stop once some beam member has
    `fp == 0`" rule -- a pure rule's own optimistic bound is just its
    own score, which the running best already reflects, so the general
    check subsumes it -- and, on searches over interval-binarized
    numeric features, cuts out the long tail of ever-longer duplicate
    rules at the same coverage that used to pad the run out after the
    real answer was already in hand. It assumes the heuristic rewards
    covering more positives and fewer negatives (`Precision`, `Laplace`,
    `WRAcc`, `Correlation`, `Accuracy`, ... all do); turn it off for one
    that doesn't (e.g. `Entropy`, symmetric in the covered-class ratio).
    The `tp == 0` floor is separate and always on -- a rule covering no
    positives is degenerate for `target_class`, not merely unpromising,
    and every one of its descendants stays that way.

    `beam_width=1` is close to `HillClimbing` over an ordinary
    `RuleHeuristic` (`HillClimbing` adds a local-maximum stop and drops
    the running-best bookkeeping a single lineage doesn't need) -- but a
    `GainHeuristic` (e.g. `FoilGain`) can't be used here at all, at any
    `beam_width`: its score is only meaningful relative to its *own*
    parent, and as soon as more than one candidate is ever in flight
    (which `beam_width=1` doesn't prevent -- multiple children from the
    same round's single parent are still compared against each other,
    which is fine, but so is comparing scores computed against
    *different* parents the moment `initial_candidates` has more than
    one entry, or a future beam_width>1 round pools children from
    multiple beam members) there's no shared scale left to rank them
    on. Rather than carve out a narrow, guarded exception for the one
    case that happens to be safe, `GainHeuristic` support lives
    entirely in `GainAscentHillClimbing` instead, whose single lineage
    makes "only one parent, ever" a standing invariant rather than
    something that needs policing here.

    `filtering` never changes the beam itself -- every round's beam is
    selected purely by `heuristic`, regardless of `filtering`, and a
    candidate in the excluded region is still specialized like any
    other. What it changes is *which* candidate is eligible to be
    returned: each round, `best_rule` advances to the highest-scoring
    candidate that also has `filtering.accept(...)` (walking down that
    round's sorted candidates past any that don't, not just checking the
    very top one). A rule in the excluded region is never returned -- if
    the search never reaches a single filter-passing rule, it returns
    `None`, not a best-effort rejected one. `filtering` also feeds
    `optimistic_pruning`'s bound (see above): since only a
    filter-passing rule can be returned, only its score is a sound thing
    to prune against, so a strict `filtering` criterion only ever delays
    the optimistic cutoff, never brings it forward.

    `stopping` gates the result exactly as `filtering` does (a rule in
    its reject region is never returned), and *additionally* halts the
    search: `stopping.evaluate(...)` is checked once per round, from the
    first refinement onward (never against the seed), against that
    round's single best-scoring candidate (the same one that would seed
    next round's beam). The moment it fires, the search stops -- if
    `stopping.accept(...)` is also true for that candidate it's returned
    directly, otherwise the search returns `best_rule` as tracked so far
    (the best rule seen that was in every criterion's acceptable region;
    `None` if there wasn't one -- e.g. FOSSIL's `Correlation < 0.3`
    firing on the first refinement, before any rule reached 0.3, returns
    `None`, not that sub-threshold rule). "Best", not "last", since
    unlike `HillClimbing`, `BeamSearch` maintains that running best
    regardless. The only thing `stopping` does that `filtering` doesn't
    is quit early -- so it can miss a deeper rule that would have
    re-entered the acceptable region a few refinements later, which
    `filtering` (running the search out) would still find.

class HillClimbing(RuleSearch):
    """Single-lineage greedy search: each round, specialize the current
    rule, score every child with a plain `RuleHeuristic`, move to
    whichever scores highest, stop at a **local maximum of the
    heuristic** -- the moment no child's score exceeds the current
    rule's own. Same idea as `BeamSearch(beam_width=1)`, but with that
    local-maximum stop it halts as soon as the greedy ascent peaks
    rather than running the lineage out; on a landscape that rises
    monotonically to a single peak (the usual case for `Precision`/
    `Laplace`/`Correlation` on a conjunctive concept) the two return the
    same rule, `HillClimbing` just reaching it with less work. Kept as
    its own class because a single lineage needs no beam dedup and no
    separately-tracked running best ("the last rule reached" is also the
    highest-scoring, since the walk only ever moves to a strictly better
    one). The same-scale parent/child comparison the local-maximum stop
    makes is valid precisely because one lineage means both are always
    scored the same way. A `GainHeuristic` needs `GainAscentHillClimbing`
    instead (this class rejects one).

    `optimistic_pruning` (default `True`) is exactly `BeamSearch`'s bound
    of the same name, restated for a single lineage: the best any
    refinement of a `(tp, fp)` rule could cover is `(tp, 0)`, so if the
    heuristic's score at that projection can't beat the best rule the
    search could still return -- the most recent filter-eligible rule, or
    (with no `filtering`) just the current one -- no real child can
    either, so the walk stops without enumerating this round's children.
    It subsumes the old `fp == 0` floor (a pure rule's `(tp, 0)`
    projection is itself), and, for a plain heuristic that rewards more
    `tp` / fewer `fp`, it never changes the result -- only skips work the
    local-maximum stop would have reached the same conclusion from. Turn
    it off for a heuristic that isn't monotone that way (`Entropy`,
    symmetric in the covered-class ratio). `tp == 0` stays a separate,
    always-on floor.

    `filtering` never affects which move gets taken -- the walk always
    follows the highest-scoring child, exactly as without it. It only
    changes what's *eligible to be returned*: this class tracks the most
    recently visited rule with `filtering.accept(...)` (a non-empty seed
    counts; the length-0 universal seed never does), and falls back to
    it whenever the walk's natural endpoint isn't itself eligible. If
    the walk never visits a single filter-passing rule, the search
    returns `None` -- a configured filter is a hard gate, not a
    best-effort preference.

    `stopping` is checked from the first refinement onward (never
    against the seed) -- each round, once the walk has moved to a new
    rule, `stopping.evaluate(...)` is checked on it *before* that rule
    is recorded as the fallback. The moment it fires, `accept(...)` on
    that same rule decides what's returned: itself, if accepted,
    otherwise the most recent rule from *strictly before* this round
    that passed both `filtering` and `stopping`'s accept (`None` if
    there wasn't one -- so `stopping` never returns a rule from its own
    reject region).

    `stop_at_local_optimum` (default `True`) is the local-maximum stop
    described above. Set it `False` and the walk instead keeps adding the
    best-scoring condition -- even one that lowers the score -- toward
    consistency (`fp == 0`). It then stops early only where growth is
    genuinely blocked or bounded: no `tp`-preserving condition left,
    `max_conditions`, or a `stopping` criterion firing (e.g.
    `ThresholdPrePruning(CoveredPositives(), 2, "<")` -- RIPPER's
    `minNo`, keeping every rule on at least two positives). This is
    RIPPER's / IREP's grow phase, and it is **only useful paired with
    post-pruning** (a `SingleRulePostProcessing` like
    `ReducedErrorPruning`): on its own it just grows maximally specific,
    overfit rules. `optimistic_pruning` has no effect once this is
    `False` -- it exists to skip work the local-maximum stop would reach
    anyway, and there is no such stop then. Leave it `True` outside the
    grow-then-prune recipe.

class GainAscentHillClimbing(HillClimbing):
    """`HillClimbing` for a `GainHeuristic` (e.g. `FoilGain`). Where the
    base class ascends a *global* per-rule objective and stops at its
    local maximum, this follows the *local gradient*: each child is
    scored by `heuristic.score(child_stats, current_stats)` -- a gain
    relative to the current rule, not an absolute score -- and the walk
    stops once the best available gain is non-positive. 0 is the only
    shared reference a gain has (two gains against different parents
    aren't the same question), but it's always a meaningful one: a
    refinement that doesn't beat its own parent is never worth taking.

    This is the only search that can run a `GainHeuristic` at all --
    `BeamSearch` can hold several candidates in flight scored against
    different parents, with no shared scale to rank them (see its
    docstring); the base `HillClimbing` rejects a `GainHeuristic`
    outright. Because a gain has no cross-round scale, "the last rule the
    walk reached" is the only well-defined answer -- there's no
    "best ever seen" to track (see `GainHeuristic`'s own docstring).

    `optimistic_pruning` (default `True`) is the base-class bound
    rephrased for a gain: the best any refinement of a `(tp, fp)` rule
    could cover is `(tp, 0)`, so if the gain *there* (against the current
    rule) is already non-positive, no real child improves on it -- stop
    without enumerating children. Subsumes the old `fp == 0` floor (a
    pure rule's `(tp, 0)` projection is itself, gain 0). A gain's
    reference is always the immediate parent, so unlike the base class
    this needs no "best returnable so far" to bound against.

    `stop_at_local_optimum=False` (inherited) turns this into RIPPER's
    grow phase: keep adding the max-`FoilGain` condition -- even past the
    point gain goes non-positive -- toward consistency (`max_conditions`
    and a `stopping` criterion still bound it). Only useful feeding a
    `ReducedErrorPruning` post-processor; see `HillClimbing`'s docstring.

    `min_gain` (default none) raises the bar from "any positive gain" to
    "a gain of at least `min_gain`" (CPAR's 0.7). It must be positive: a
    condition that changes nothing gains exactly 0.

    `branch_similarity` (default none) makes the search yield several
    rules (`search_all`; `search` still returns the best-gain lineage's
    rule alone): at every step it also follows each child whose gain is
    at least ``branch_similarity`` times the best one (and worth moving to
    at all), as a copy of the rule that is grown on the same way -- CPAR's
    search (Yin & Han 2003), usable in any `SeCo` learner. See
    `HillClimbing._branching_walk`.

    """Exhaustive search for the best rule -- with `k`, the `k` best -- by
    branch and bound, after OPUS (Webb, "OPUS: An efficient admissible
    algorithm for unordered search", JAIR 1995). Unlike `BeamSearch` and
    the hill climbers, the rule it returns is optimal: no conjunction of
    the open conditions (up to `max_conditions` of them) scores higher.

    The search space is the set-enumeration tree over the open
    conditions: a rule is only ever extended by conditions after its last
    one in feature order, so every condition set is generated at most
    once. Nodes are expanded best-first, by their *bound* -- the score of
    the best refinement conceivable, every covered positive kept and every
    covered negative dropped (the ``(tp, 0)`` projection `BeamSearch`'s
    `optimistic_pruning` uses). A node whose bound can't beat the `k`-th
    best rule found so far is never expanded, and the search ends as soon
    as no node left can. The bound is only admissible for a heuristic that
    rewards covering more positives and fewer negatives (`Laplace`,
    `WRAcc`, `Precision`, `Accuracy`, ...; not e.g. `Entropy`); the
    heuristic must also score each rule on its own -- a `GainHeuristic`
    is refused.

    As in OPUS, a condition is removed from the whole subtree below a
    node (not just from its own branch) once it can't help there: when
    the child adding it is bounded out (any rule containing that child
    is bounded by it, too), when it covers no positive (nor does any
    refinement), or when it drops no covered row (it changes nothing).
    Constraint propagation does the rest (`Rule.specialize`): conditions
    implied by the rule, or contradicting it, are never offered.

    With `dominance_pruning` (default), Webb's *cannotImprove* rule
    removes more: a condition that drops no covered negative (the same
    rule without it covers the same negatives and at least the same
    positives, so it scores at least as high), and a condition whose
    child is dominated by a sibling's -- the sibling covers every
    positive it covers and none of the negatives it drops -- since
    swapping the condition for the sibling's never lowers a score.
    Dominated rules aren't worse, only no better, so this is only sound
    for the single best rule: it is skipped with `k > 1` and with a
    `filtering`/`stopping` criterion (the dominating rule might be one
    they reject).

    The `k` best rules (`search_all`; `search` returns the best) have
    pairwise different coverage -- a rule covering exactly the same rows
    as one already kept is skipped; among equal scores, the one found
    first is kept. `filtering` restricts which rules may be kept;
    `stopping` also stops expanding a rule it fires on. One batched count
    per expanded node, so it runs on every data representation.

    Exhaustive means exponential in the worst case: `max_conditions`
    bounds the depth, and pruning keeps typical searches far from it.

    from there is therefore guaranteed to cover the seed (a proper
    subset of a True-valued feature set stays True on that example), so
    AQ never has to check "does this still cover the seed?" explicitly --
    the open mask enforces it.

    `strategy` picks *which* uncovered positive:
    - ``"first"`` (default) -- the lowest-indexed one; fully
      deterministic, and the order examples happen to sit in the data is
      as good as any other arbitrary choice for a noise-free covering.
    - ``"random"`` -- a uniformly random uncovered positive (`random_state`
      seeds it); over several runs this explores different rules first,
      which matters when `maxstar` trimming makes the search order-
      sensitive.
    - ``"index"`` -- seed on the exact row `index`, whatever its class
      (`target_class` is ignored -- callers pass the row's own label).
      `example_mask` is ignored too. This is how `pyrulearn.learners.pylord.PyLORD`
      seeds a search on *every* example in turn, rather than one per

    Explicit-negation features make "the features the seed satisfies"
    already include every "attribute X is absent" the seed warrants
    (its negation feature is the True one), so a seed rule can still
    grow conditions like ``not smoker`` -- nothing special is needed for
    negation here.

    Raises `ValueError` if there is no uncovered positive to seed on --

class SeCo(DecomposingLearner, NativeRuleLearner):
    """Sequential covering: repeatedly call `single_rule_learner` for
    `target_class`, accept what it finds, and remove every example the
    accepted rule covers -- both classes, not just positives -- from
    further consideration (the standard separate-and-conquer covering
    policy; see Fürnkranz's survey), until `stop_covering` says to stop
    or no positive examples remain uncovered. Removing negatives too
    (not just the positives just explained) matches the textbook
    definition of "separate": each subsequent rule only ever needs to
    prove itself against what's left, not the whole original dataset.

    `stop_covering` is a `pyrulearn.pruning.PrePruningCriterion` -- the
    same type a search's `filtering=`/`stopping=`
    take -- but consulted only through its bare `evaluate()`, once per
    learned rule, between `SingleRuleLearner.learn_one_rule` calls: the
    moment it fires, the just-learned rule is discarded (never appended
    to `rules`) and the whole covering loop halts. `polarity`/`reject`/
    `accept` play no role here and can be left at their defaults --
    they exist to resolve *which* rule to hand back when a search stops
    partway through refining (`BeamSearch`'s best-so-far vs. the
    hill-climbers' last-visited), a question that doesn't arise at
    this level: there's exactly one covering loop, never a population
    of candidates to filter among, so a fired criterion always simply
    means "stop, and throw away what was just found" -- see
    `PrePruningCriterion`'s own docstring for the filtering/stopping
    distinction this collapses away here. `stats` (passed to `evaluate`
    already computed, same reasoning as everywhere else it's threaded
    through rather than recomputed) is the just-learned rule's stats
    *within the current covering scope* (`remaining` -- not the full
    dataset) -- e.g. `ThresholdPrePruning(UncoveredPositives(),
    -p, ">=")` reads `stats.fn` (how many positives would still need
    explaining once this rule is added) to stop once at most `p` remain.

    Unconditional floor, independent of any criterion configured here:
    `SeCo` stops once every positive example is covered (nothing left
    to explain), `single_rule_learner` returns `None` (its search found
    nothing passing its own `filtering` -- no acceptable rule left to
    add), the just-learned rule covers no new positives at all
    (`stats.tp == 0` within the remaining scope -- adding it would be
    pure waste, and letting the loop continue could add rule after rule
    that changes nothing), or the rule is length 0 (unconditional --
    confirmed directly as a real failure mode of `ReducedErrorPruning`
    on a noisy pruning sample, see its own docstring; this is a second
    layer of defense in case the search itself ever concludes an
    unconditional rule is "best", not just pruning degrading to one).
    These are all direct checks in `fit` itself, not routed through
    `stop_covering`, for the same reason `RuleSearch` keeps its own
    floor unwrapped -- see that class's docstring. `max_rules` is a
    separate, hardcoded resource budget for the same reason a search
    keeps `max_conditions` outside the criterion system too -- a hard
    cap, not a quality judgment.

    **Which model `fit` builds** (see `pyrulearn.learners.RuleLearner.fit`):

    - `fit(data, model=ConceptModel, label="a")` -- the definition of one
      concept: the covering loop for ``"a"`` vs. everything else. Setting
      `target_class="a"` at construction makes this the default (`label`
      then comes from `target_class`).
    - `fit(data)` with no `target_class` -- the family multi-class default
      (`_MULTICLASS_DEFAULT`): `ConceptSet` (one-vs-rest) for the SeCo
      family, `DecisionList` (one seed-covering loop) for `AQR`.
    - `fit(data, model=ConceptSet | ConceptCascade | PairwiseModel)` --
      one-vs-rest / ordered peeling / round robin, via `DecomposingLearner`
      (each fits per-class copies through the covering loop).
    - `fit(data, model=DecisionList)` -- `_seed_covering_fit`: one covering
      loop over all classes at once (random uncovered example -> its label
      as the head -> learn -> remove -> repeat; AQ's multi-class covering),
      rules in learn order, first match wins.
    - `fit(data, model=FlatRuleSet)` -- the same rules, as a rule set
      resolved by learn order (`ListCombiner()`), e.g. to compare other
      combiners on them.

    `SeCo` takes no default-prediction or combiner arguments -- it sets
    sensible ones on the result (`MajorityClass(data)` fallback;
    `HeuristicMaxCombiner()` for a `ConceptSet`) and leaves the rest to the caller. Reassign
    either on the returned model.

    Learned rules carry no declarative weight -- `HeuristicMaxCombiner()`
    (`Laplace` by default) scores each rule from
    its own *measured* `stats()` at predict time instead, the same
    default `sort_rules`/`covered_by` use for inspection; pass
    `combiner=HeuristicMaxCombiner(SomeHeuristic())` for a different one.

    `covering` (a `CoveringStrategy`, default `RemovalCovering`) is how
    the scope changes after each accepted rule: removing everything the
    rule covers (the description above), or `WeightedCovering` --
    reweighting the examples by a `Reweighting` scheme instead, so rules
    may overlap (CN2-SD, CPAR), until its `CoveringStop` criteria. Only
    the binary covering loop uses it; the all-classes seed covering
    (`model=DecisionList`) always removes. `SeCo` builds unweighted rule
    sets, so a reweighting that fits rule weights (boosting,
    `AdaBoostReweighting`) belongs to a boosting learner such as
    `pyrulearn.learners.boosting.Slipper`, and is refused here.

    `optimization` (a `RuleSetOptimizer`, default `None`) runs once the
    covering loop is done, reworking the whole class's rules before they
    become a `FlatRuleSet` -- RIPPER's optimization phase. Only in the
    binary path (`target_class` set, or a per-class stage of a decomposition);
    ignored by the all-classes seed covering (`model=DecisionList` /
    `FlatRuleSet`), which has no single target class.

    just a `SeCo` subclass whose constructor picks specific building
    blocks as defaults, while still accepting every one of them as an
    override.

    Two choices define CN2 here:
    - **search heuristic**: `Laplace` -- Clark & Boswell's replacement
      for original CN2's entropy-based one, with their number of classes
      in the denominator: each `fit` sets `Laplace(n_classes=c)` for the
      data's ``c`` classes unless `heuristic` is given (`Laplace()` for
      the two-class form whatever the data).
    - **significance test, as a *stopping* criterion**: CN2's own
      description (Clark & Boswell) checks, inside the search itself,
      whether the round's best candidate is still statistically
      significant (`LikelihoodRatio`, CN2's own G-test statistic) --
      and if not, halts and returns the best significant rule found so
      far, rather than testing only the search's finished answer once
      at the end. That's exactly `BeamSearch`'s `stopping` (see
      `PrePruningCriterion`/`BeamSearch`'s own docstrings): `evaluate`
      is "no longer significant" (`LikelihoodRatio() < threshold`), and
      the default `polarity=True` reads correctly (reject the
      insignificant ones). Both `stopping` and `filtering` refuse to
      *return* an insignificant rule -- if a covering iteration never
      reaches a significant one, the search returns `None` and `SeCo`
      ends the loop, so an over-strict threshold shows up as a short or
      empty ruleset either way. They differ only in reach: `stopping`
      halts the search the moment the round's best candidate goes
      insignificant, so it can miss a rule that would have regained
      significance a few refinements deeper -- as `filtering` the
      criterion lets the search run out and can still find that rule
      (``CN2(filtering=ThresholdPrePruning(LikelihoodRatio(), 3.841,
      operator="<"))``). Pass
      `significance_threshold=None` to disable the criterion entirely
      (every rule the search lands on is accepted, same as calling
      `SeCo` directly with a `Laplace` heuristic and no `stopping`).

    `significance_threshold` defaults to 3.841, the chi-squared critical
    value at alpha=0.05 with 1 degree of freedom -- the significance
    level most commonly cited for CN2's own test; there's no single
    "the" CN2 default in the literature, so treat this as a reasonable
    starting point, not a fact about the original algorithm.

    `beam_width` defaults to 5 (the original paper's "star size"); pass
    `search` directly instead for anything beyond adjusting beam width
    (e.g. `max_conditions`, or a future non-beam `RuleSearch`) --
    `beam_width` is ignored if `search` is given explicitly.

    `preparation`/`postprocessing` default to `NoSplit`/
    `NoPostProcessing` -- unlike RIPPER/IREP, CN2 has no grow/prune split
    or post-hoc single-rule pruning; the significance test above is its
    only quality gate.

    `filtering`/`stopping`, if passed explicitly, override
    `significance_threshold`'s default construction entirely: the
    significance test is the default `stopping` criterion (gate the
    result *and* halt early) only while neither is given. To use it as a
    `filtering` criterion instead (gate the result, run the search out),
    pass it as such.

    `fit(data)`'s default `ConceptSet` uses `MicroVoteCombiner`, not the
    family's generic `HeuristicMaxCombiner()` -- see `_fit_one_vs_rest` below for
    why. Measured empirically to make little difference on real data
    (rows where covering rules actually disagree in target are rare, and
    even then the two combiners' accuracy differs by a fraction of a
    point either way); the point is matching what Clark & Boswell's own
    algorithm does, not a functional improvement.

class AQR(SeCo):
    """AQR (Clark & Niblett, 1989) -- their reimplementation of Michalski's
    AQ, the algorithm CN2 was designed against, here as `CN2`'s sibling
    `SeCo` subclass. Three choices define it:

    - **search-space start: a single-example seed** (`SeedExample`). Each
      rule is grown as a generalization of one still-uncovered positive
      example, never from the fully-open empty rule -- the defining
      difference from `CN2`'s general-to-specific beam. See
      `SeedExample`'s docstring; ``space_init=SeedExample("random",
      random_state)`` picks a random uncovered positive instead of the
      first.

    - **evaluation: a `LEF`** (Michalski's Lexicographic Evaluation
      Functional, `pyrulearn.heuristics.LEF`). Clark & Niblett describe
      AQ as ranking a complex by *the number of positive examples it
      covers* -- `CoveredPositives`. That alone is a poor way to trim the
      partial star mid-search (it can't tell a nearly-consistent complex
      from an over-general one at the same positive coverage), so the
      default LEF adds two tie-breaks that are standard in Michalski's
      own AQ LEFs and inert at the point a consistent rule is finally
      chosen: `CoveredNegatives` (minimize covered negatives -- steers
      the beam toward completable complexes, the job negative-guided
      star growth does in classical AQ) then `MinimalLength` (minimize
      selectors). Pass any `RuleHeuristic` as `heuristic=` to change it
      -- a bare `CoveredPositives()` for the letter of the paper, a
      different `LEF`, or something else entirely (this is exactly
      `CN2`'s `heuristic=` override, which also accepts a `LEF`).

    - **stopping: consistency, as a *filtering* criterion**. AQR requires
      every rule to cover **no** negative examples -- it has no
      significance test and no noise tolerance (that lack is the whole
      point of Clark & Niblett's comparison: AQR overfits noisy data,
      CN2's significance test does not). That requirement is
      `ThresholdPrePruning(CoveredNegatives(), 0, "<")` as `filtering=`:
      a rule with `fp > 0` is never returned, and if a covering
      iteration can't reach a consistent rule at all, the search returns
      `None` and `SeCo` ends -- so un-fittable (e.g. noisy) data shows up
      as a short or empty ruleset. Pass `require_consistency=False` to
      drop the gate, or `filtering=`/`stopping=` to supply your own.

    The `SeCo` covering loop needs no adjustment for AQR: because every
    accepted rule is consistent, "remove every example the rule covers"
    removes only positives, and every negative stays in scope for every
    subsequent rule -- exactly classical AQ's covering.

    **What this is not (yet):** the search here is `BeamSearch` over the
    seed-restricted feature space, not AQ's literal *star* construction
    (grow the partial star by "add a selector that excludes a specific
    still-covered negative", trim to `maxstar` after each negative). With
    the consistency filter and a negatives-aware LEF the rules found are
    materially the same, and `beam_width == maxstar`, but the classical
    star is more efficient (its per-step candidate set is only the
    selectors that distinguish the seed from some covered negative) and
    *is* by definition "the set of maximally-general consistent
    complexes". A dedicated star `RuleSearch` can be passed as `search=`
    when one exists.

    `beam_width`/`maxstar` default to 5 (the paper's star size); ignored
    if `search` is passed explicitly. `preparation`/`postprocessing`
    default to `NoSplit`/`NoPostProcessing` -- AQR (in the 1989 paper)
    has neither a grow/prune split nor rule truncation.

    **Multi-class:** `AQR`'s `fit(data)` default is `model=DecisionList` --
    one covering loop over all classes (`SeCo._seed_covering_fit`): pick a
    random uncovered example, take its label as the head, learn a
    consistent rule seeded on it, remove what it covers, repeat. That's
    AQ's own multi-class covering. A rule is consistent only within its
    own covering scope, so rules of different classes can still overlap
    on examples an earlier rule had already removed; the list resolves
    that by learn order, and prints in that order. Pass
    `model=ConceptSet` / `ConceptCascade` / `PairwiseModel` for a
    decomposition instead, or `model=ConceptModel, label=...` (or a
    `target_class`) for one binary problem. `random_state` seeds the
    example picks.

    Two choices define PFoil here:

      write down than to list the positives it covers. Its default

    Mooney's own PFOIL (the propositional restriction of FOIL described

    correlation coefficient) as the rule-refinement heuristic, with
    `correlation_threshold` (default 0.3, FOSSIL's own published value)
    as the quality gate.

    **Hill climbing, not beam search.** FOSSIL's own search is a
    top-down hill-climbing loop -- add the one condition that most
    improves correlation, repeat, stop when nothing improves it -- and
    that's what `PFossil` now does: `HillClimbing` over `Correlation()`
    directly (`HillClimbing` ranks any plain `RuleHeuristic`; no
    `DeltaGain` wrapping needed). `HillClimbing`'s local-optimum stop --
    move on only to a child that beats the current rule's own
    correlation -- *is* "stop when correlation would no longer
    increase", so the search halts at the nearest correlation maximum,
    typically after a handful of conditions.

    This replaces an earlier `BeamSearch(beam_width=5)` + `Correlation`
    default that behaved badly on two fronts, both confirmed on the
    binary-UCI benchmark suite (`demos/seco_learners_comparison`):

    - *Runaway search.* `Correlation` evaluated at the beam's top
      candidate rarely drops below 0.3 as conditions are added (near-
      redundant interval literals barely move it), and its optimistic
      `(tp, 0)` bound sits near 1.0, so neither `stopping` nor
      `BeamSearch`'s optimistic pruning fired -- the beam ran to
      feature-mask exhaustion, exploring rules 40-90 conditions deep
      before returning a short one. Hill climbing stops at the
      correlation peak (~5 conditions), 5-25x faster.
    - *Over-general rules.* `Correlation` (like `WRAcc`; symmetric about
      the ROC diagonal) rewards a rule for covering the positive class
      *and* correctly excluding the negatives -- but in a first-match
      decision list only precision-on-what-fires matters. The beam
      would settle on high-coverage, ~55%-precision rules; sequential
      covering then blanketed the data with the target class and
      accuracy collapsed toward its base rate. Greedily following the
      correlation gradient from the empty rule adds negatives-removing
      conditions first and stops earlier, landing on tighter rules.

    `correlation_threshold` is wired as the `filtering` criterion
    ``ThresholdPrePruning(Correlation(), correlation_threshold, "<")``
    while neither `filtering` nor `stopping` is given: the local-optimum
    stop already decides *when to stop climbing*; the threshold only
    decides *whether the rule the climb lands on is worth keeping* -- if
    its correlation is below the threshold the search returns `None` and
    `SeCo` ends its covering loop. Passing the same criterion as
    `stopping` instead also halts the climb the moment correlation dips
    below it (returning the rule from just before, or `None` if there
    wasn't one yet) -- earlier than the natural peak, so it tends to
    underfit (often one rule). Either way a sub-threshold rule is never
    returned (before 2026, the stopping variant did append them, which
    is what wrecked accuracy). Pass `correlation_threshold=None` to drop
    the gate entirely (every rule the climb lands on is accepted).

    Beam search -- the pre-2026 default -- is still available explicitly:

    Rule Induction*), not a port of Cohen's code: IREP\\* growth-and-pruning
    plus the `ReplaceReviseOptimization` phase, run per class. See the
    covering-loop stop below for how it differs from the original.

    `fit(data)` returns a `pyrulearn.models.ConceptCascade`: rules for the
    rarest class first, then the next, ..., the most frequent class as the
    catch-all default -- exactly RIPPER's class handling
    (least-frequent-first ordered peeling). Other model types via
    `fit(data, model=...)`:

    - `ConceptModel` -- binary Pypper for one class (`label=` / a
      `target_class`), IREP\\* + optimization, no peeling.
    - `SingleRule` -- just one grown-and-pruned rule for a class, no
      covering loop and no optimization phase.
    - `ConceptSet` -- one-vs-rest Pypper (each class its own full loop).
    - `PairwiseModel` -- round-robin Pypper.
    - `FlatRuleSet` / `DecisionList` -- via the `ConceptSet -> FlatRuleSet`
      / `ConceptCascade -> DecisionList` converters.

    (Pypper has no `FlatRuleSet` seed-covering producer -- it is not a
    seed-covering algorithm -- but still reaches `FlatRuleSet` by
    flattening its one-vs-rest `ConceptSet`.)

    Per class, a `SeCo` covering loop where each rule is:
    - **grown** by `FoilGain` on a 2/3 growing split (`GrowPruneSplit`),
      with `GainAscentHillClimbing(stop_at_local_optimum=False)` -- IREP's
      grow phase: add the max-gain condition until the rule is consistent
      (or it would drop below two covered positives, RIPPER's `minNo`,
      wired as a `stopping` criterion), *not* stopping at a gain peak,
    - **pruned** -- trailing conditions dropped by `ReducedErrorPruning`
      on the 1/3 held-out split (`Precision`, monotone with RIPPER's own
      ``(p-n)/(p+n)`` rule-value metric),
    then the whole class's rules go through `ReplaceReviseOptimization(k)`
    (`k=2` passes by default).

    The covering loop stops (`stop_covering=`) on whichever fires first
    of `pyrulearn.pruning.EncodingLengthRestriction` (FOIL's per-rule MDL
    stop) and IREP's rule (Fürnkranz & Widmer, 1994): halt once a pruned
    rule's precision on the covering scope drops below 0.5 -- a rule no
    better than a coin flip, and every rule after it, only degrades the
    set. This stands in for Cohen's exact "total ruleset DL is >64 bits
    over the minimum seen" rule (which would also need a retroactive
    trim-back the per-rule `PrePruningCriterion` interface can't express);
    the IREP stop is cruder but is itself a published stopping rule, and
    it fixes the same failure -- a covering loop that keeps tacking on
    low-precision rules until the MDL-guided optimization latches onto
    one of them. There is also no post-optimization residual IREP\\* --
    see `ReplaceReviseOptimization`.

    `k` -- optimization passes. `prune_fraction` -- held-out split size
    for grow/prune (both IREP\\* and the optimization). `grow_heuristic`/
    `search` -- override the growth heuristic / search (defaults `FoilGain`
    and `GainAscentHillClimbing(stop_at_local_optimum=False)`; pass your
    own `search` and you own its `stop_at_local_optimum` too).
    `random_state` seeds every split and the class-order tie-break.
