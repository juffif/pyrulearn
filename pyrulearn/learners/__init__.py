"""
pyrulearn.learners
=====================

`RuleLearner` and its shared machinery -- everything about turning a
`DataRepresentation` into rules via a uniform `fit(data, model=None) ->
RuleModel`, re-exported here from `pyrulearn.learners.base`:
`RuleLearner`, `ExternalRuleLearner`, `NativeRuleLearner`,
`DecomposingLearner` (the `fit(data, model=ConceptSet |
ConceptCascade | PairwiseModel)` multiclass-by-binary-decomposition
switcher), `RelabelingExternalLearner` (external algorithms that can't
fold "the rest" into one label themselves), and the `@produces(...)`
decorator.

Concrete learners live in their own submodules, same
group-by-shared-implementation convention as `pyrulearn.interfaces`:
`pyrulearn.learners.seco` (`SeCo` framework -- `CN2`, `AQR`, `PFoil`,
`PFossil`, `Pypper`), `pyrulearn.learners.pylord` (`PyLORD`),
`pyrulearn.learners.associative` (`ClassAssociationRuleMiner`, and the
`RuleDistiller` mixin shared by the classifiers that consume a rule
pool), `pyrulearn.learners.cba` (`CBA`), `pyrulearn.learners.cmar`
(`CMAR`), `pyrulearn.learners.ids` (`IDS`), and
`pyrulearn.learners.multiclass` (`OneVsRest`/`OrderedOneVsRest`/
`Pairwise` -- thin sugar over `DecomposingLearner`). External-tool
learners (sklearn/wittgenstein/imodels/Weka/LORD) live next to their
importer in `pyrulearn.interfaces` instead, since each pairs a learner
with the `ObjectRuleImporter`/`StringRuleImporter` that reads its output
back -- not duplicated here.
