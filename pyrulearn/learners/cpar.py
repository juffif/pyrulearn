=======================

`CPAR` -- Classification based on Predictive Association Rules (Yin &
Han, SDM 2003): FOIL-style rule growing on weighted examples (their PRM,
Predictive Rule Mining) that follows every condition nearly as good as
the best one, so that one search can yield several rules; covered
positives are down-weighted instead of removed; and a class is predicted
by the mean expected accuracy of its best `k` rules covering the example.

Two implementations of the same algorithm, learning the same models:

- `CPAR` is a configuration of the separate-and-conquer framework
  `pyrulearn.learners.seco.SeCo`: `FoilGain` as the heuristic,
  `GainAscentHillClimbing(min_gain=..., branch_similarity=...)` as the
  search (the branching is what yields several rules per search),
  `WeightedCovering(MultiplicativeReweighting, PositiveWeightBelow)` as
  the covering, and `pyrulearn.combiners.TopKMeanCombiner` for
  prediction. Every part can be exchanged, and it runs on every data
  representation.
- `DenseCPAR` is the same algorithm specialized for speed: it scores
  every feature of a search node in one matrix product over a dense
  float copy of `data.X`, without constraint propagation, so it needs a
  `BooleanDataRepresentation`. Same parameters, same models, 2-4x
  faster than `CPAR`.

The README (*Native learning algorithms*, "Components first, specialized
versions second") uses the pair as the example of how pyrulearn trades
the two off.

    """CPAR (Yin & Han 2003). For each class `c` against the rest:

    1. Grow rules on the current example weights, FOIL-style: starting
       from the empty rule, repeatedly add the condition with the highest
       weighted FOIL gain ``P* (log2 P*/(P*+N*) - log2 P/(P+N))`` (``P``,
       ``N``: the weights of the positives and negatives the rule covers,
       ``P*``, ``N*`` with the condition added), until no condition gains
       at least `min_gain`. Every other condition whose gain is within
       `gain_similarity` of the best (``gain >= best * gain_similarity``)
       starts a copy of the rule that is grown further the same way -- so
       one search can yield several rules.
    2. For each rule found, multiply the weights of the positives it
       covers by `decay` (`MultiplicativeReweighting`); negatives keep
       their weight.
    3. Repeat until the positives' total weight is below
       `min_total_weight` of the start (`PositiveWeightBelow`), or no rule
       is found.

    The model is a `ConceptSet` with one `ConceptModel` per class (rules
    found more than once appear once). A class is predicted by the mean
    expected accuracy ``(nc + 1) / (n + K)`` (``K`` classes; the rules'
    training stats) of its best `k` rules covering the example
    (`TopKMeanCombiner` with `GeneralizedMEstimate(m=K, cost=1/K)`); rows
    no rule covers get the majority class.

    Defaults are the paper's: ``decay = 2/3``, ``min_total_weight =
    0.05``, ``min_gain = 0.7``, ``gain_similarity = 0.99``, ``k = 5``.
    `gain_similarity = 1` (only exact ties copied) is close to PRM without
    copying. Numeric attributes come already binarized
    (`pyrulearn.data.io.build_dataspec`); the data's row weights multiply
    with the covering weights. `max_length` (default none) caps rule
    length, `max_rounds` the number of rules per class.

    **A configuration of `SeCo`.** CPAR is the separate-and-conquer
    framework with these building blocks -- nothing CPAR-specific is left
    in this class but the choice of them:

    - heuristic: `heuristic` (default `FoilGain()`), a `GainHeuristic`,
      since `min_gain` and `gain_similarity` are thresholds on an
      improvement over the rule before the condition; `DeltaGain(h)`
      makes one from any plain heuristic `h`;
    - search: `GainAscentHillClimbing(max_conditions=max_length,
      min_gain=min_gain, branch_similarity=gain_similarity)` -- step 1;
      its `search_all` yields every lineage's rule, and `SeCo`'s covering
      loop accepts each;
    - covering: `covering` (default ``WeightedCovering(
      MultiplicativeReweighting(decay), PositiveWeightBelow(
      min_total_weight), max_rounds=max_rounds)``) -- steps 2 and 3; e.g.
      `AdditiveReweighting` (CN2-SD), or `RemovalCovering` for plain
      separate-and-conquer;
    - prediction: `combiner` (default the top-`k` mean above).

    So the same parts combine differently elsewhere: `PFoil` with a
    branching search, or `CPAR` with another covering. As a `SeCo` it also
    decomposes classes like the other SeCo learners (`model=ConceptCascade`,
    `model=PairwiseModel`), and runs on every data representation.

    `DenseCPAR` is the same algorithm specialized for speed on a
    `BooleanDataRepresentation`: same parameters, same models, 2-4x
    faster. An implied condition never changes coverage, so its FOIL
    gain is 0, below `min_gain` -- `DenseCPAR` never picks one either,
    the search's constraint propagation only spares `CPAR` from scoring it.
