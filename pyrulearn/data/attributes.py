pyrulearn.data.attributes
=========================

Typed attributes (boolean / nominal / numeric / set / hierarchical /
relational) and the machinery to:

1. Generate the derived *Boolean* features a rule actually conditions on
   (e.g. nominal attribute ``color`` with domain ``{red, green, blue}``
   becomes three Boolean features ``color=red``, ``color=green``,
   ``color=blue``; numeric attribute ``age`` with cut points
   ``{20, 30, 40}`` becomes ``age>=20``, ``age>=30``, ``age>=40``; set
   attribute ``tags`` becomes one membership feature per possible tag;
   hierarchical attribute ``region`` becomes one equality feature per
   tree node). ``Rule``/``Literal`` never need to change for this -- they
   still just index into a flat Boolean feature space; what's new is that
   some features now carry *provenance* (which attribute(s), which test)
   via ``FeatureSpec``.

2. Derive the **constraints** that automatically hold among features
   coming from the same attribute:
   - a nominal (or Boolean) attribute's features -- the ``attr=v``
     equality tests (exactly one True: mutually exclusive + exhaustive)
     plus, if negation was declared, the parallel ``attr!=v`` tests
     (each the exact negation of its ``=v``) -- are governed by one
     ``NominalGroup`` per attribute. ``ExactlyOne`` is the degenerate
     no-negation case, kept for that and for merge compatibility.
   - a numeric attribute's ``attr>=t`` features form a monotonic chain
     (``attr>=t_high`` implies ``attr>=t_low`` for ``t_low<=t_high``);
     with negation, the parallel ``attr<t`` features are exact
     complements. One ``NumericGroup`` per attribute owns both;
     ``ThresholdChain`` is the no-negation / ``le_thresholds`` case.
   - hierarchy sibling nodes (children of the same parent) are mutually
     exclusive but *not* assumed exhaustive (``MutuallyExclusive``), and
     each node implies its parent (``Implies``, chained up the tree).
   - set-valued membership features and relational (multi-attribute
     derived) features carry no automatic constraints -- their values are
     independent as far as this module can infer.

   All are ``Constraint`` subclasses implementing a shared
   ``propagate(fixed)`` interface: given a partial True/False assignment
   over their features, return whatever *additional* assignments are
   forced, or raise ``ValueError`` if the partial assignment is already
   contradictory. ``DataSpec.propagate`` (see ``dataspec.py``) iterates
   all constraints to a fixed point, which is what lets a ``Rule`` ask
   "is this internally consistent?" and "what does this rule imply that
   it doesn't say explicitly?".
