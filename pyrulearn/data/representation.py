pyrulearn.data.representation
=================================

`DataRepresentation`: a concrete encoding of a dataset bound to a
`pyrulearn.data.spec.DataSpec`. `DataSpec` itself is pure schema (feature
names/order, typed attributes, constraints, missing-value policy) -- no
data; a `DataRepresentation` is where the actual values live, always
pointing back at the `DataSpec` it was built against.

`HorizontalBitmapRepresentation` is the canonical one: a `numpy.packbits`-
packed Boolean matrix (plus labels). `NListRepresentation` is the same
data as a PPC-tree / N-list vertical index (the one Huynh,
Fürnkranz & Beck's LORD builds); `SparseDataRepresentation` is a `scipy`
CSR/CSC encoding -- the N-list without the prefix tree. All three sit
behind the identical interface, so every `pyrulearn.learners.seco` learner runs
on any of them. All point at an ordinary `DataSpec`; further encodings
some future algorithm wants directly are further `DataRepresentation`
subclasses.

Every representation implements the primitives the rule-learning code
is written against: `coverage(rule)` (the boolean covered-rows vector)
and `features_of(row)` (a seed example's True features) for one-shot
use outside a search (prediction, pruning, `RuleStats.from_rule` --
`Rule.covers_data`/`Rule.covers_data_packed` just forward to
`data.coverage(self)`); and, for `pyrulearn.learners.seco.BeamSearch`/
`HillClimbing`'s incremental search fast path, `initial_cover`,
`refine_cover`, `cover_counts`, and `cover_rows`, built around an
opaque, representation-specific "cover handle" so each encoding can
make refining a rule by one more literal as cheap as its own storage
allows (see `NListRepresentation`'s own docstring for the interesting
case).

Because a `DataSpec` no longer carries any data of its own, the same
`DataSpec` instance can be shared verbatim across multiple
`DataRepresentation`s built from it (e.g. a train split and a test
split), guaranteeing identical feature indexing between them by
construction rather than by convention.

    """Base for a concrete encoding of a dataset bound to a `DataSpec`.

    Two abstract primitives make every representation a drop-in for the
    rule-learning machinery, regardless of how it stores the data
    internally:

    - `coverage(rule)` -- the boolean "which rows does this rule cover"
      vector every heuristic, search and covering loop is ultimately
      defined over (`RuleStats.from_rule` does the ``& example_mask &
      (y == class)`` counting on top of it). `Rule.covers_data` /
      `Rule.covers_data_packed` just forward here.
    - `features_of(row)` -- the feature indices that are True in one row,
      needed to seed a search from an example (`pyrulearn.learners.seco.
      SeedExample`).

    **Row weights.** `weights` (``None``: every row counts 1) are
    non-negative per-row weights that belong to the data -- e.g. how
    often a row was observed, or its importance -- given to the
    constructor or set with `with_weights`. Every count the learners
    make is then a sum of weights: the searches' `cover_counts`,
    `pyrulearn.evaluation.RuleStats.from_rule`, and a model's
    `evaluate`, and so the training stats rules store and print. The
    `example_mask` a search is restricted to may itself be a weight
    vector instead of a boolean mask (weighted covering, see
    `pyrulearn.learners.seco.WeightedCovering`); the two multiply
    (`scope`). Without weights the counts stay plain integers.

    behind the same `DataRepresentation` interface as
    `HorizontalBitmapRepresentation`, so every learner runs on it unchanged.
    The tree *is* the data: it is stored instead of the Boolean table, not
    next to it.

    How it works
    ------------
    Each row is the set of features that are True in it. Sort those
    features most-frequent-first and insert the resulting path into a
    trie; rows with a shared prefix share tree nodes, and each row ends at
    one node (the root for a row with no True feature). The nodes are
    numbered in pre-order, and the rows are kept in the order of the node
    they end at -- so the rows whose path passes through a node, those
    ending in its subtree, are one contiguous range of that order
    (`_row_lo`/`_row_hi`). Every node also keeps the bitmask of the
    features on its root-to-here path (`_words`). That is all that is
    stored per node; per row, only its place in the order (`_perm`) and the
    node it ends at (`_row_end`). A row's features are the bits of its end
    node's path, so `features_of` and `X` read the data back from the tree.

    A rule ``f1 ∧ ... ∧ fm`` covers exactly the rows whose path contains
    a node for every ``fi``. Take ``iy``, the deepest (least frequent) of
    the ``fi``; among the nodes registering ``iy`` (its N-list, contiguous
    in `_words` -- `_item_ptr`), keep those whose path bitmask has every
    ``fi``; the rule's coverage is the union of their row ranges (disjoint:
    no node of an item lies below another of the same item). Class counts
    of a node are differences of cumulative per-class sums over the rows
    in tree order (`_class_cum`) -- and under an `example_mask` or weights,
    of cumulative sums of those, built once per search
    (`_NListMaskContext`).

    `coverage`/`features_of` (used outside a search: prediction, pruning,
    `RuleStats.from_rule`) always recompute from scratch this way.
    `pyrulearn.learners.seco.BeamSearch`/`HillClimbing` instead go through
    `initial_cover`/`refine_cover`/`cover_counts` -- see the comment above
    `initial_cover` for the LORD-style incremental scheme: a handle tracks
    the deepest feature fixed so far (its "anchor") and the still-shrinking
    set of that item's nodes still satisfying the rule, so refining by a
    feature no deeper than the anchor is just a filter over the *current*
    (already narrow) set, and only refining by a strictly deeper feature
    needs a fresh look at that item's own N-list.

    Negation hurts this representation too: pairing every feature with
    its negation doubles each row's path length (every original feature
    *or* its negation is True, so both occupy a tree position), so fewer
    rows share a full prefix and the tree gets more nodes for the same
    underlying data. `without_negations()` before building (or on an
    already-negated representation) is the fix.

    Build it from an existing `HorizontalBitmapRepresentation` with
    `from_boolean`, or from raw arrays via the constructor / `from_xy` /
    `from_dataframe`, mirroring `HorizontalBitmapRepresentation`.

    Best when the data is genuinely sparse -- one-hot expansions of
    high-cardinality nominals, bag-of-words. Negation actively works

    attributes are -- not "sparse" at all, and worse than the packed
