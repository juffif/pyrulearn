"""
pyrulearn.data.spec
======================

`DataSpec` is a pure feature-space specification (names, count, typed
attributes, constraints, missing-value policy) -- no data. See
`pyrulearn.data.representation` for `DataRepresentation`/
`HorizontalBitmapRepresentation`, which hold the actual values (a
`DataRepresentation` always points back at the `DataSpec` it was built
against). Because a `DataSpec` carries no data, the same instance can be
shared verbatim across multiple representations built from it (e.g. a
train split and a test split), guaranteeing identical feature indexing
between them by construction rather than by convention -- useful when
hand-writing rules, or importing rules from an external learner, before
any dataset has even been loaded.

Beyond plain Boolean feature names, a DataSpec can optionally know the
**typed attributes** (boolean/nominal/numeric/set/hierarchical/
relational) its features derive from, via `feature_specs` -- and the
**constraints** those attributes imply among their derived features
(mutual exclusion for nominal equality tests, monotonic chains for
numeric threshold tests, sibling exclusion + upward implication for
hierarchy nodes; see `pyrulearn.data.attributes`). Building a DataSpec this
way is what lets a `Rule` ask whether it's internally consistent, or what
it implies beyond its explicit conditions -- see `DataSpec.propagate` and
`Rule.is_consistent` / `Rule.implied_conditions`.

Two ways to build one:
- Plain: ``DataSpec(feature_names=[...])`` -- every feature is
  attribute-less (the original, simplest use case).
- Typed: ``DataSpecBuilder().add_nominal(...).add_numeric(...).build()``
  -- generates feature names/specs/constraints from attribute
  declarations automatically.

        Names of the Boolean features, in index order. Canonical source
        of truth for `n_features` and for resolving names <-> indices.
    name : str, optional

        only.
    feature_specs : sequence of FeatureSpec, optional
        Provenance for each feature (which attribute/test it derives
        from), parallel to `feature_names`. Usually set via
        `DataSpecBuilder` rather than by hand. Defaults to plain,
        attribute-less specs if omitted.
    attributes : dict of str -> Attribute, optional
        The typed attributes referenced by `feature_specs`, keyed by name.
    constraints : sequence of Constraint, optional
        Relationships auto-derived from `attributes` (mutual exclusion /
        threshold chains / hierarchy edges). See `DataSpec.propagate`.
    missing_strategy : MissingStrategy, optional
        This spec's own default for how `pyrulearn.data.io.binarize`
        should handle missing raw values when reading data against it
        -- falls back to `DataSpec.DEFAULT_MISSING_STRATEGY`

        bound the attribute from one side only. A `NumericGroup` owns the
        ``>=`` chain and the complement links.

        exact logical complement of ``x>t``, not of ``x>=t`` (``x<=t``
        and ``NOT(x>=t)`` disagree exactly at ``x==t``), so folding it

        features are fed to their group in *descending* threshold order,

        right for their mirrored monotonicity. Importers use this family
        for learners that write ``<=`` conditions (Weka, wittgenstein).

        The two families are independent and not cross-checked against
        each other -- nothing stops a rule from stating both
        ``age>=30`` and ``age<=25`` (impossible to satisfy, but not
        flagged inconsistent; it will simply never cover any real
        example, which for rules read in from an external source, as
        opposed to hand-built, is the normal and sufficient outcome).
        Giving the *same* value to both `ge_thresholds` and
        `le_thresholds` is one way to represent ``attribute==value`` as a
